# 04 — Analysis Engine and Security Rules

> Team/platform update (2026-11-02): [team handoff](21_TEAM_HANDOFF.md), [finite next-phase plan](22_NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md), and [current portability/publication evidence](23_PORTABILITY_AND_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md) supersede earlier onboarding, remote-state and platform assumptions. Historical checks below retain their original date and scope.


The [competition checkpoint](../spec/06_COMPETITION_VERIFICATION.md) records the current live Meta outcome and separate executable DATA, TRUST, and actor/action/resource assessments. The historical baseline below describes the earlier fixed FastAPI scan.

## Integrated demo status — 2026-11-02

The approved [demo contract](16_DEMO_DELIVERY_CONTRACT.md) is implemented alongside the preserved first-slice analyzer: immutable hash-verified bundles, disabled/mock explanations with a gated Meta adapter, and a fixed React/Vite/TypeScript/Cytoscape viewer. See [capability gates](17_CAPABILITY_AND_RESEARCH_REPORT.md), [finite evaluation](18_DEMO_EVALUATION.md), and [integrated verification](19_INTEGRATED_DEMO_REVIEW.md) for current checks and review disposition. Document 14 remains historical first-slice evidence; its 73-test count is not the integrated total.

At this 2026-11-02 checkpoint, the recorded milestones were baseline `7797b85`, integrated demo `4f0346c`, and viewer refinement `2cda191`. The demo ran offline. The later [competition verification](../spec/06_COMPETITION_VERIFICATION.md) records the live Meta result, public Pages deployment, and separate controlled DATA, TRUST, and actor/action/resource reports. Fixed synthetic intake remains the supported scope.

## Implemented LS-AUTH-001

The rule assesses whether a policy-required authorization function declaration is recognized along a supported endpoint-to-protected-operation structural path. Operator-authored `policy.json` supplies exact qualified identities, severity/impact assumptions and author/time provenance. The separate expected-results oracle is not read by the analyzer.

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| Supported path/control scope with matching required declaration | Suppress candidate; effectiveness remains unverified |
| Supported path/control scope without recognized required declaration | LOW-confidence CANDIDATE / NEEDS_REVIEW / POTENTIAL_GAP |
| Opaque control scope, unresolved path or ambiguous symbol | NEEDS_CONTEXT diagnostic only |
| Operation has no operator policy | No candidate or sensitivity guess |

Authentication alone does not satisfy a policy requiring authorization. Declarations from supported app/router/include/decorator/parameter scopes use observed DEPENDS_ON edges. They do not become claims of successful enforcement. Unsupported middleware, factories, subdependencies, aliases and dynamic behavior are handled conservatively under the contract.

Every candidate carries rule/version, repository revision, ordered node/edge path, evidence IDs, policy impact hypothesis, assumptions, unknowns, false-positive considerations and human review steps. `Finding` in `models.py` is authoritative. Severity reflects policy-assumed impact; LOW confidence reflects limited declaration evidence; coverage records supported scope separately. No exploitability score or confirmed status is implemented.

The measured fixture produces candidates for GET /weak and GET /authenticated, recognizes three matching declarations with effectiveness unverified, and leaves the public/no-policy path unflagged. Dynamic registration remains a coverage diagnostic.

## Controlled rule assessments and broader scope

**LS-DATA-001:** candidate untrusted/sensitive flow to a classified sink. The fixed synthetic assessment verifies value origin against an explicit policy. Canonical integration requires evidence for wider value propagation, source/sink classification, and context-specific controls. CALLS edges carry call relationships only.

**LS-TRUST-001:** candidate handling gap across an explicitly modeled trust boundary. The fixed synthetic assessment checks an explicit zone transition and handling declaration. Canonical integration requires boundary and handling evidence for each supported application scope. The assessment leaves runtime enforcement unverified.

Dependency advisory correlation, configuration/secrets analysis, access-control inconsistencies, logging exposure and cloud/runtime context are later ideas. No common GraphRule protocol is implemented. The explanation pipeline validates references without adjudicating finding truth; freeze new detector interfaces only for a selected increment.

## Model interpretation guardrails

The optional explanation provider may explain supplied evidence or identify missing context. It may not invent graph/source facts, establish absent controls from missing extraction, confirm vulnerabilities, execute payloads or modify targets. Schema/evidence-reference validation and minimized synthetic context are implemented under document 16; the competition checkpoint records the validated live result and the separately reviewed narrative. Threat-category/ASVS mappings require verified source identifiers; none should be guessed.
