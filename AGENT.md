# AGENT.md — Living Project Log

> **This file is the live status ledger for all coding agents.** Update it after every meaningful task/session. Do not delete historical session notes. Keep the top-level status current and append dated session entries.

## Teammate quick start — Claude Code and Codex

1. Read [shared instructions](AGENTS.md), [team setup/module map](docs/21_TEAM_HANDOFF.md), [latest platform/release evidence](docs/23_PORTABILITY_AND_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md), then [next-phase assignments](docs/22_NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md). Claude Code also loads [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
2. From a clone on macOS Terminal or Windows PowerShell: `uv sync --project backend --locked`, `npm ci --prefix frontend --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`, `uv run --project backend --locked python scripts/verify_demo.py`, then `npm run dev --prefix frontend`. No key is needed.
3. Fixed fixture only; scan with `uv run --project backend --locked lazarus scan --target fixture:fastapi-demo`. Expected exit2/PARTIAL is a seeded coverage gap, not a broken setup.
4. Choose one assigned task, coordinate file ownership, work on a topic branch from remote main, test and open a PR. Do not restart completed work, overlap edits, read secrets, make paid calls or widen intake.
5. Preserve owner model routing: Astra for critical/security decisions; Claude Code can perform routine work but must not pretend to provide Astra. If unavailable, stop that critical decision for an owner-approved fallback.

`AGENT.md` is the only living log filename. Do not create a case-variant `Agent.md`; keep historical notes below and append new measured results.

## Current status

- **Project:** Lazarus Sentinel
- **Status:** Integrated fixed synthetic demo complete; 139 backend tests (plus one Windows-only skip on macOS), 16 frontend tests and quality checks pass; independent Astra review accepted. Live access/submission and platform-expansion gates remain explicit in docs/19_INTEGRATED_DEMO_REVIEW.md.
- **Blueprint audit:** [spec/README.md](spec/README.md) maps 107 scope items and all 28 Appendix B bullets; the original three-detector MVP remains incomplete. Next analysis step is a controlled semantic contract, alongside teammate reproduction.
- **Current phase:** Team-ready source published on GitHub main; native Windows/macOS/Linux CI verified. See docs/23_PORTABILITY_AND_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md.
- **Primary MVP language/framework:** CPython 3.13.14 analyzing a synthetic FastAPI fixture without importing FastAPI.
- **Primary code-analysis candidate:** Python AST structure adapter; Joern NOT_ATTEMPTED (absent from PATH; no failed POC claim).
- **Graph computation:** NetworkX for MVP.
- **Persistence:** SQLite for scans/findings/artifact references; normalized JSON graph/findings/coverage and Markdown reports.
- **Workflow orchestration:** Linear Python pipeline; LangGraph deferred.
- **Frontend:** React/Vite/TypeScript/Cytoscape fixed synthetic bundle viewer plus CLI/JSON/Markdown; HTTP API skipped.
- **Runtime model provider:** Disabled by default; deterministic mock and bounded Standard Meta adapter implemented. Live API access verified on one settled synthetic request (USD 0.007014 at ledger rates). Explanation recording remains incomplete. USD 3/five-attempt application cap.
- **MVP mode:** Controlled fixture ID only; read-only parsing; candidate findings; no automatic fixes, arbitrary repositories, or target execution.

## Owner's model preferences

- Critical architecture/security reasoning and difficult decisions: **Astra only**.
- Routine coding and ordinary research: **GPT-6.1 Sol** preferred.
- Visual/UI and scoped screen-oriented tasks: **GPT-6.1 Terra**.
- Record actual available model labels and use only supported options. If Astra is unavailable for a critical decision, pause and ask the owner rather than silently substituting.

## Team / agent roles

- **Coordinator:** owns architecture, integration, task board, and this file.
- **Research agent:** read-only compatibility checks and source verification.
- **Backend/graph agent:** graph adapters, schema, backend, and storage after contract freeze.
- **Frontend agent:** UI and graph visualization against stable contracts.
- **QA/security reviewer:** tests, evidence traceability, safe-input handling, coverage gaps, and false-positive review.

Use independent sub-agents if available, ideally up to three concurrent workers. Avoid concurrent edits to the same files.

## Current decisions

1. The product is graph-first application-security intelligence, not a generic scanner chatbot.
2. A literally complete graph is not promised. The product reports coverage, unresolved edges, unsupported constructs, inferred facts, and unknowns.
3. Graph extraction and security rules are deterministic wherever possible; LLM reasoning is evidence-bounded.
4. The first product target is a controlled FastAPI repository with known positive and negative examples.
5. First delivery implements LS-AUTH-001 declaration-context assessment only; LS-DATA-001 and LS-TRUST-001 remain NOT_IMPLEMENTED under D-014–D-020.
6. Joern is a candidate backend, not an unquestioned dependency. Prove the path with a spike first.
7. NetworkX + SQLite + JSON artifacts are enough for the MVP; no Neo4j/distributed system initially.
8. No code modification or exploitation. Human analysts own remediation.

## Current task summary

### Completed

- [x] Product thesis and defensive boundaries documented.
- [x] Three graph layers defined conceptually: code structure, application architecture, security context.
- [x] Initial graph node/edge vocabulary drafted.
- [x] Initial three detection families selected.
- [x] LangGraph orchestration pattern documented.
- [x] Model-routing, sub-agent, MCP/skill discovery and logging instructions documented.
- [x] Repository-specific architecture verified: documentation-only initial state; approved contract in docs/13_FIRST_SLICE_CONTRACT.md.
- Joern/Python/FastAPI spike is deferred, NOT_ATTEMPTED; see N09 rather than treating it as an incomplete first-slice acceptance gate.
- [x] Minimal graph pipeline implemented and verified for the controlled synthetic fixture.

### Current work state

- No first-slice implementation task is open. Environment, integration, final Astra review and documentation closeout are complete.
- Owner approved integrated demo execution on 2026-11-02; parallel implementation is in progress under docs/16_DEMO_DELIVERY_CONTRACT.md.

### Deferred / unverified

- Joern/Python/FastAPI POC remains NOT_ATTEMPTED; no installation requested for this slice.
- Data-flow and trust rules remain NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
- Meta account access, participant acceptance, UI/API, LangGraph, live provider integration and arbitrary-repository isolation remain separate gates.

### Next actions (recommended; not implementation authorization)

1. N01–N02: owner confirms event participation/portal rules and provider access requirements; live synthetic requests require a separately authorized check.
2. N03–N05: preserve a versioned local baseline, review fixture/evaluation cases and freeze the next demo interface/cut line.
3. N06–N08: selected fixed artifact viewer and evidence-bounded explanation work; HTTP is optional and live Meta is gated.
4. N12–N13: integrated evaluation/review, feature freeze, reproducible demo and actual submission receipt. Optional analyzers/rules are N09–N11; post-demo expansion is N14–N18.

Full owners, prerequisites, exit criteria, proposed IST schedule and scope cuts: [docs/15_NEXT_STEPS.md](docs/15_NEXT_STEPS.md). None of these follow-on features has been implemented by the documentation refresh.

## Session history

### 2026-11-01 — Documentation pack prepared

**Goal:** Prepare a Codex-ready engineering handoff from the research blueprint.

**Work completed:** Defined repository instructions, living project ledger, project charter, requirements, architecture, graph schema, analysis rules, LangGraph workflow, API/storage contracts, frontend design, security model, evaluation plan, implementation sequence, decision register, sources, task board, and bootstrap prompt.

**Verification:** Current official documentation links were checked while assembling the pack. No repository code has been inspected or implemented yet.

**Next 3 actions:** Inspect the actual Mac/Codex environment; run Joern/Python/FastAPI feasibility spike; implement the first end-to-end graph pipeline.

### 2026-11-01 — Evidence-first implementation and independent review

**Goal:** Execute the owner-approved contract in docs/13_FIRST_SLICE_CONTRACT.md, preserving the documentation-only/no-Git workspace and the defensive boundary.

**Model(s) used:** Sol delegated for implementation/tests; Astra for critical decisions and independent security review. Runtime identifiers gpt-6.1-sol / gpt-6-astra were exercised; coordinator display label was not exposed. Terra was not needed.

**Sub-agents used:** core (models/intake/worker and acceptance tests), extraction (AST/FastAPI/fixture), application (rules/CLI/storage/report), and egm_critical_review (read-only Astra). Shared interfaces were frozen before integration; ownership boundaries were separate.

**Files created/changed:** backend package and tests, backend/pyproject.toml and uv.lock, .python-version/.gitignore, synthetic fixture and separate oracle, bootstrap/README, specification scope notices, decision register, task board, and living log. No Git repository was initialized; nothing was committed or published.

**Work completed:** Bounded no-follow manifest intake; exact byte snapshots; credential-free deadline-bounded parser; deterministic graph/evidence; conservative FastAPI control scope; LS-AUTH-001 low-confidence candidates; exact byte/range evidence gate; SQLite committed references; atomic artifact publication; escaped hash-only report. No source imports/execution or external model calls.

**Review repairs:** Tests reproduced and repaired opaque dependency subdependencies/annotations/defaults, constructor hooks, non-top-level router inclusion, rebound/deleted/duplicate symbols, colliding module names, intermediate opaque path scopes, and root/output symlink handling. Unknown controls remain diagnostics only. Final independent Astra review approved the controlled first slice after 17 uncertainty probes and two behavior-preservation control probes.

**Commands / setup:** Approved project-local `uv sync --python 3.13.14 --group dev` created the environment/lockfile; the first sandbox attempt failed on PyPI DNS and the same sync succeeded with network permission. No global installation. Initial scaffold test-first attempts were blocked by unavailable pytest; no behavioral RED is claimed for that initial scaffolding. Later material regression repairs had observed failing tests before fixes.

**Decisions:** D-014–D-020. Joern NOT_ATTEMPTED; data/trust rules NOT_IMPLEMENTED; linear fixture-only CLI; no live provider, API, UI, or arbitrary-repository intake.

### 2026-11-02 — Resumed verification and documentation closeout

**Goal:** Complete interrupted closeout, verify the report-only usability change, and refresh evidence without expanding scope.

**Commands and results (fresh):**

- `cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` — **73 passed in 1.30s**.
- `cd backend && .venv/bin/ruff check src tests` — clean.
- `cd backend && .venv/bin/ruff format --check src tests` — **21 files already formatted**.
- `cd backend && .venv/bin/mypy src` — **11 source files clean**, strict configuration.
- Two actual `backend/.venv/bin/lazarus scan --target fixture:fastapi-demo` runs — exit **2 / PARTIAL**, identical complete graph JSON, **23 nodes / 36 edges / 2 findings**.
- Reloaded graph validates against current source snapshot; every committed artifact reference has matching size and SHA256. Report endpoint/path labels and dependency-effectiveness caveat verified.
- Astra reread report.py/test_report.py and approved the escaped metadata-only display change; prior fixture-only security approval remains in force.

**Measured fixture outcome:** Six supported endpoints; candidates `GET /weak` and `GET /authenticated`; three matching authorization declarations recognized with effectiveness unverified; public/no-policy path unflagged; dynamic registration explicitly unsupported. Latest scan `0ab604f2-f6f3-458e-9665-44c426f9b98f`. Revision `revision:sha256:b9cbcb3c59a1e4220ef42f5dcf5dea3a482e364f9907cfd6d5d81fe33ee9d49d`.

**Work products:** [Latest report](artifacts/scans/0ab604f2-f6f3-458e-9665-44c426f9b98f/report.md); [machine-readable verification](artifacts/verification.json); [implementation/review summary](docs/14_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md).

**Limitations / unknowns:** Static syntax relationships do not prove runtime reachability, effective authorization, exploitability, or data flow. Conservative unknown suppression can miss candidates. Parser process limits and sanitized environment are not an OS filesystem/network sandbox. Output prechecks reject existing aliases, not concurrent hostile filesystem replacement. Rename followed by SQLite commit can leave unreferenced orphan files after a crash; readers expose committed references only. Arbitrary repositories, uploads, API/UI, LangGraph, live Meta, Joern POC and submission readiness remain unverified/deferred.

**Blockers:** None for the approved first slice. No additional implementation is required for this milestone.

**Next 3 actions:** Review generated report; select next bounded capability; complete separate authorization/privacy/isolation gates before broadening intake or enabling external models.

### 2026-11-02 — Full maintained Markdown reconciliation and next-step checklist

**Goal:** Update every maintained project Markdown document to match the completed first slice and provide a complete ordered remaining-work list.

**Models / delegation:** Sol reconciled docs 00–09 against actual models, service, storage, worker and CLI. Astra reviewed the recommended roadmap/security gates read-only. Coordinator owns shared ledgers, sources, README, continuation prompt and docs 10–15. Model policy and defensive boundaries are unchanged.

**Changes:** Current versus future capability is now explicit throughout document bodies; obsolete empty-project, mandatory Joern-first, three-detector and mandatory API/LangGraph instructions are removed. README and bootstrap point to current scope/evidence first. docs/15_NEXT_STEPS.md and TASK_BOARD.md share N01–N18 with dependencies/owners/exit criteria. The source register distinguishes newly reopened official pages from older references. Prior dated session history and generated scan reports remain historical evidence.

**Source refresh:** On 2026-11-02 the public event page still listed Nov 4, 9:00 PM ET (Nov 5, 7:30 AM IST). Official Meta overview and data-use modes were reopened; owner acceptance, complete portal requirements, actual account capability and live requests remain unverified. No provider request or secret read/write occurred.

**Verification scope:** Documentation/link/manifest consistency and unchanged source/test/fixture/dependency fingerprints are checked for this documentation-only task. The 73-test/Ruff/mypy/scan outcomes above are the existing verified baseline, not a newly claimed test run for rewritten Markdown. No product code, dependencies, Git repository, external service, deployment or submission changed.

**Next 3 actions:** Resolve N01 event gates; resolve N02 provider prerequisites in parallel with local work; select/freeze N03–N06 baseline and fixed artifact viewer scope. The full list is in document 15.

**Documentation-closeout results:** 21 maintained Markdown files reconciled. Local links, JSON examples, code fences, pack_manifest.json coverage and N01–N18 task-ID mirroring all validated. SHA256 fingerprints of backend source/tests, Python fixture files, pyproject.toml and uv.lock match their pre-refresh values. Astra approved the final roadmap/checklist read-only with no material contradiction. No product checks were rerun for these documentation-only edits; the earlier 73-test baseline remains explicitly dated. Historical generated scan artifacts were not rewritten.

### 2026-11-02 — Integrated demo execution started

**Goal:** Implement the approved parallel demo-first plan, then bounded optional/expansion work with explicit gates.
**Baseline:** Local Git initialized and reviewed source/docs/fixtures committed as 7797b85; feature branch feat/integrated-demo. Existing identity used; no remote/publication/license selection. Original blueprint PDF remains user-owned untracked input.
**Contract:** docs/16_DEMO_DELIVERY_CONTRACT.md freezes bundle/explanation/viewer shapes and caps. Hard model budget USD3/five live attempts; no configured MODEL_API_KEY/META_API_KEY in current process, so real calls remain gated. Owner event acceptance/portal rules unknown. Fixed fixture analysis remains unchanged.
**Assignments:** Sol backend modules/tests; Terra frontend; independent Sol QA/compatibility/research; one integration worker after handoffs; Astra security review. Root owns shared contracts/ledgers and acceptance. No concurrent shared-file ownership.
**State:** In progress; results will be appended after measured checks. Missing external gates are not completed by mock operation.


### 2026-11-02 — Interrupted agents resumed and integrated demo accepted

**Continuation:** Prior workers had ended after the session limit; their saved files were retained. Restarted bounded Sol integration, read-only Astra security review and Sol documentation reconciliation. No completed component was reimplemented. Actual supported model IDs exercised: gpt-6.1-sol, gpt-6.1-terra and gpt-6-astra; coordinator display label not exposed. Existing MCP/plugin tools reused; no global tool/plugin installation.

**Delivered:** Read-only committed-artifact loader and immutable export; generated schema contract; default-disabled/mock explanation annotations and live adapter with transactional USD3/five-attempt reservations; fixed React graph/path/evidence/coverage viewer; controlled variants, artifact inspector, reproduction scripts and credential-free CI configuration. docs/19_INTEGRATED_DEMO_REVIEW.md records the exact delivery and N01–N18 statuses.

**Fresh checks:** Full pytest115 passed; frontend8 tests passed; Ruff check/format (35 Python files) and strict mypy passed. scripts/verify_demo.py passed all nine checks. A formatting-only repair to scripts/prepare_demo.py resolved the sole initial integrated check failure. Two fresh scans aaccee49-bdd3-4133-8771-cbf935889925 and ed2ddbc5-3646-432e-b912-cb2f0ef3b1ba yielded identical graph bytes (23nodes/36edges/2findings, expected PARTIAL). Existing eight scans/32artifact refs inspected read-only with no issues before these two new scans.

**Browser/review:** Final desktop1440/mobile320 document widths match viewports; table-local scrolling, graph resize/refit and keyboard exact4-node/3-edge path selection verified. 200% equivalent CDP reflow/DPR tested, native browser zoom unverified. Astra independently passed40focused backend tests/8frontend tests and revalidated shipped bundle/current source; no material security issue remaining in scoped synthetic demo.

**Reproducibility:** Fresh source copy in /private/tmp excluding environments, generated artifacts, credentials and build output; npm ci --ignore-scripts --offline succeeded. uv locked offline setup lacked cached mypy; explicit network-enabled locked sync installed the missing project-local dependencies. This is a clean working-tree copy, not a claim of hosted CI execution. All nine checks passed in the clean copy. Final clean-copy result is recorded in artifacts/clean-copy-verification.json.

**Limits and next actions:** Meta credentials absent; zero live calls/US$0. Event eligibility/portal submission and license undecided; no remote publication or submission. Joern setup blocked (analysis NOT_ATTEMPTED); DATA/TRUST NOT_IMPLEMENTED. sandbox-exec launch denied, so N14/N15 remain BLOCKED. Finite N16–N18 evaluation/operations/research deliverables are complete, not their open-ended product programs. Preserve original blueprint PDF and historical scans. Next: owner external gates, bounded live verification when prerequisites pass, then reviewed isolation infrastructure.


### 2026-11-02 — Viewer clarity and graph refinement

**Owner request:** Use UI UX Pro Max and Impeccable to improve the graph, immediate product comprehension and documentation. Owner selected all three audiences (first-time/demo, developers and security reviewers). Continued the existing visual world rather than replacing its identity.

**Team:** Sol graph projection/rendering/tests; Terra shell/responsive styles/tests; independent Astra truth/semantics review; coordinator integration/browser/docs. Shared Network props were frozen before parallel edits. Both requested skills were read/applied; Impeccable context/detector and UIUX local chart/React searches ran. Official Cytoscape layout/preset and NNGroup progressive-disclosure references informed the selected-path-first design.

**Delivered:** Guided explanation, searchable six-endpoint selector, exact focused path and deterministic full23node/36edge graph, typed node cards, labeled arrows, Fit/zoom/reset controls, selected-node evidence inspection and expandable raw identities. Noncandidate selection clears stale assessment/mock state. Real declaration relationships remain unverified context, never extra candidate-path steps. No new dependencies, backend changes or packaged artifact modifications (19fingerprints unchanged).

**Verification:**115backend/16frontend tests and all9scripts/verify_demo.py checks pass. Astra independently passed16frontend tests and accepted the display semantics with no material issue. Browser1440/320/720reflow no document overflow; exact4node/3edge path, fullgraphmembership, keyboardinspection, zoom/reset/fit and noncandidateclearing checked. Mobile600px verticalpath and44x44viewportbuttons verified. Impeccable detector flaggedselectedsideborder; single repairbatch replacedit and improvedlabels/layout. One zoomed captureclipped;Fitrestoredpath;8boundedcandidate switchesfitallnodes after2frames. Nativezoom/screenreader nottested. Existinglargechunkwarning remains. No paid/livecalls.

**Work products:** docs/20_VIEWER_CLARITY_AND_DESIGN.md; artifacts/viewer-v2-verification.json; artifacts/viewer-v2-browser-verification.json; focused/full/mobile screenshots under artifacts/browser/viewer-v2-*.png. README/frontend specification/bootstrap/taskboard/decisionregister updated. Historicalscanreports remain unchanged.

**Next:** Gather actual audiencefeedback; measure loading/rendering before code-splitting/layout expansion; retain existing externalprovider/event/isolationgates.


### 2026-11-02 — Team handoff and native-platform publication preparation

**Owner scope:** Refresh all maintained documentation, provide Claude Code/Codex teammate instructions and a finite next-phase plan, support macOS/Windows, and publish to the named GitHub repository. Interrupted sessions ended; saved work was retained and final Sol QA/Astra review restarted without rebuilding completed features.

**Delivered:** Shared AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md entry points, canonical AGENT.md quickstart, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs21teamhandoff/22finiteplan/23releaseevidence, portable commands throughout maintained docs, LF checkout policy and three-OS CI. Native compatibility changes cover reserved Windows names/reparse points, bounded binary fixture reads, minimal SystemRoot worker environment, Windows spawn provider child, fixed-byte scan writer lock and portable scripts. POSIX descriptor no-follow/resource behavior preserved.

**Review and checks:** Astra caught and required repairs for Windows-only imports/locking, inspector drive-path interpretation and environment casing. Final source review accepted repaired runtime/static guards. Fresh local138backendtests pass, one Windows-only junction test skips onmacOS;16frontendtests pass;allnineofflinechecks pass. Strictmypy default/win32/darwin/linux each clean16sourcefiles. Native CI remains pending at this preparation checkpoint; no Windows pass is claimed from Mac mocks.

**Publication boundary:** Destination verifiedempty/public/pushauthorized; no forcepush. Code, synthetic fixtures/assets, lockfiles, docs and CI are selected. Credentials, environments, generated scan/database/build outputs and the original unreviewed PDF remain excluded. License, live Meta, event/submission and hostile-intake isolation gates remain unresolved. Final remote/nativeCI evidence belongs in document23.

Liveprovider and broaderintake gatesunchanged.


### 2026-11-02 — Original blueprint audit and next-stage specification

Owner requested a full comparison of the 33-page original blueprint with current implementation and a separate root planning folder. Created [spec/README.md](spec/README.md), source/page-linked implementation audit, gated next-stage plan and master checklist. Sol inventoried requirements; Astra independently reviewed semantic claims and stage gates. Coordinator verified corrections: CLASS declaration/containment extraction exists, while inheritance/type semantics do not; valid model citations do not establish free-text factuality.

Audit catalogue: 107 scope items — 37 IMPLEMENTED, 34 PARTIAL, 25 NOT_IMPLEMENTED, 6 BLOCKED, 3 SUPERSEDED and 2 NOT_APPLICABLE. The MVP-only inventory has 78 rows (33 implemented, 31 partial, 11 absent, 3 blocked). Counts are unweighted inventory items, not completion percentages or accuracy. All 28 Appendix B bullets and sections 1–20/appendices A–D are mapped. Accepted reduced demo remains complete; original three-detector MVP remains incomplete.

Next recommended analysis assignment: freeze one controlled semantic capability with exact syntax/policy/evidence and positive/control/unknown cases before coding. P03 teammate reproduction and owner prerequisite decisions can proceed in parallel. Isolation must be demonstrated before broader intake; optional website work does not close detector gaps.

Verification for this documentation-only session: 35 manifest files and 300 relative links resolve; 107 unique consecutive IDs agree between audit/checklist; 28 Appendix B bullets map; PDF SHA256 unchanged; backend/frontend/scripts/CI source unchanged from tested 06f993e. Existing 139 backend/16 frontend results are recorded prior evidence, not rerun here. Independent Astra review accepted stage order with the two claim corrections applied. Original confidential PDF remains local/untracked; extracted text/renderings remain ignored artifacts. No feature changes, paid calls, tool installation, deployment, submission or publication in this session.


### 2026-11-02 — Credential-free environment template

Added root `.env.example` with blank `MODEL_API_KEY`, matching the backend's actual environment lookup. README explains macOS/PowerShell copying and explicit `uv run --env-file .env` loading; no dotenv dependency or automatic loading was added. Existing `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`/variants while allowing `.env.example`. Owner explicitly requested that secret `.env` files not be inspected: none were opened, read, loaded or modified. Verified template contents, ignore rules and installed uv's `--env-file` option without loading secrets; no API calls or behavior tests performed. Historical MODEL_API_KEY/META_API_KEY mentions are environment-check notes; the adapter currently consumes only MODEL_API_KEY.


### 2026-11-03 — Contributor readiness, CI rewrite and issue backlog

Claude Code (Sonnet 5.5) filed 40 GitHub issues (#1–#40) with new labels, rewrote CI into backend/frontend/verify jobs (triggers: push to main, pull_request, workflow_dispatch; concurrency; CodeQL; Dependabot), and added issue/PR templates, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, a new README and CONTRIBUTING via PR #41. No product code, fixtures or artifacts changed. Full details, evidence and open limits: [docs/24_CONTRIBUTOR_READINESS_AND_CI.md](docs/24_CONTRIBUTOR_READINESS_AND_CI.md). Local: ruff clean, 139 backend tests passed, 1 skipped. PR #41 checks: all passed except macOS verify, which was still waiting for a hosted runner. Earlier main run 41494823283 failed only through a cancelled macOS job, not code. License still undecided (issue #40).

### 2026-11-03 — First bounded Meta API check

The owner authorized one synthetic live request using the configured key. uv loaded the local credential into the CLI process. Only safe status fields were captured. Standard Muse Spark 1.3 pricing and Chat Completions were checked against the provider docs before the request. The existing ledger recorded one SETTLED attempt, 100000 micro-USD reserved and 7014 micro-USD estimated usage. This verifies authenticated transport and usage reporting. The CLI returned INTERNAL_ERROR after settlement and saved no annotation. The precise post-settlement cause is unknown because the original response was discarded. No request was repeated.

An offline regression reproduced the generic CLI error for a schema-invalid explanation. Those validation errors now return META_INVALID_EXPLANATION without echoing provider output or publishing a sidecar. This change does not identify the original failure.

### 2026-11-03 — Controlled semantic experiment

The owner approved the available coordinator and an independent reviewer for this increment after the requested Astra route could not be verified. The fallback reviewer froze the straight-line provenance contract in [spec/04](spec/04_CONTROLLED_SEMANTIC_EXPERIMENT.md). The implementation worker added the standalone script, a fixed 12-file synthetic corpus, a separate oracle and focused tests. The reviewer independently checked six unseen inputs and accepted the bounded experiment. Agent routing labels were requested through the supported delegation interface. The worker's underlying model display label was not independently verified.

S01 and the selected standard-library AST S04 experiment passed. Ran `backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/semantic_spike.py` under a 30-second outer deadline on macOS arm64, CPython 3.13.14. The report matched 12 of 12 expected results (four flows, four negative controls, four unknowns). Local artifact: `artifacts/semantic-spike/0be59eeb-9904-4b97-98a7-e4fb767b22e8/result.json`. Ruff lint and format, strict backend mypy and backend pytest passed (151 passed, one Windows-only skip). Fresh Windows/Linux execution remains unverified. Production DATA and TRUST remain unimplemented. S05 requires a separate security policy, semantic-path validator and review.

### GitHub PR triage and local main sync

Reviewed open PRs #42–49 and confirmed #41 was already in main. Squash-merged #49 (keyboard navigation), #42 (artifact action), #48 (CodeQL action), #44 (build tooling minimum), and #45 (Cytoscape types) after all eight checks passed on each reviewed head. GitHub and local main advanced to 7437e20. Kept #43, #46 and #47 open for separate major-upgrade review. The Vitest macOS check was cancelled. The local semantic experiment and API diagnostic edits remained uncommitted and were preserved during the branch switch.

### Remaining dependency PRs

Merged mypy #43 and Vitest #47 after eight passing checks on each reviewed head. Vitest's replacement CI passed on macOS, Windows and Ubuntu. Closed Vite #46 for a dedicated migration because Vite 8 changes the bundler and default browser targets. Fast-forwarded local main to 03600d8. GitHub listed no open PRs at verification.

### Next-phase baseline verification

Preserved the existing provenance experiment and provider diagnostic changes on a scoped branch from 03600d8. Installed locked dependencies including mypy 2.4.1 and Vitest 5.0.5. All nine checks in the offline verifier passed on macOS. The verifier reported zero live provider attempts. The private blueprint and generated evidence remain local.

### Next-phase implementation and integration

Baseline 96b93e6 passed native Windows, macOS and Ubuntu CI and merged as 66bed8c in PR #50. P07's offline CLI tests exercise real parsing, annotation validation and budget accounting through stubbed transport. Malformed or truncated content emits META_INVALID_RESPONSE, known usage settles, and missing usage retains the reservation and prevents a second transport. Independent offline review and all 29 focused provider tests passed. No live request or credential access this increment. The security reviewer could not independently verify Astra routing, so the new live attempt remains gated.

P05 measurements and P04 local browser evidence are in document 22. P10 root and subpath production builds passed browser checks for both validated and corrupt artifacts. Pages workflow is manual and opt-in, with an output allowlist. Local full offline verifier passed nine checks, with 161 backend tests passed plus one skip and 18 frontend tests passed. P03 awaits a second teammate machine. P06 owner decisions and P08 approved isolation runner remain open. P09 depends on measured isolation.

### Demo closeout

Merged PR #51 at ec7754d after eight project checks passed. A fresh clone on the same Mac installed the locks, passed the nine-check offline verifier and produced the expected PARTIAL scan (exit 2, 23 nodes, 36 edges and two candidates). The initial offline install lacked a pinned wheel, so the successful install used the package registries. Added a verify-only rehearsal path that generated a fresh validated mock explanation bundle without replacing tracked viewer assets. See [closeout guide](spec/05_DEMO_CLOSEOUT.md) for the walkthrough, teammate evidence requirements and next AI pilot. Live Meta and Pages remain subject to the required security review.
